# SDSU Class Registration - Automated
---
This project automates class registration given inputs of class schedule numbers.

## What is the problem being solved?

One of the most stressful occurrences of a student every semester is class registration. Usually an enormous amount of time and energy is spent to coordinate meetings and figure out the classes needed to be taken, though this process which should take minutes sometimes takes closer to half an hour. 

## How did I solve the problem?

Upon learning Selenium and spending a couple of hours playing around with how courses are indexed and looking through the javascript code behind the registration website, I was able to use Chrome Driver and Selenium to automatically go to the intended semester, and register for the intended classes via schedule number. This also covers edge cases pertaining to whether or not an individual was going to join a waitlist, or register normally.
